# Bivariate Normal Distrubution
I produced Bivariate normal with marginal pdf's using jax and matplotlib
## Files
All the file related to this work are placed in the folder called question 1
The Documentation_bivariateNormalDistribution will walk you through what is Bivariate Normal distribution and what is Probability Density Function(or density function or PDF) of a Bivariate Gaussian distribution.
The binomialMultivariate file contains the visualization which is easy to understand
All the references which i used in animating Bivariate Normal Distribution is mentioned in the documentation

# MultiLayer Perceptron
This is a two hidden layers neural network classifier build from scratch using pytorch and jax on google colab.
## Dataset and files
All the files related to this work are placed in the folder called question 3
I used MNIST dataset for this purpose and manually optimized the number of neuron in hidden layers.
The Documentation_multipleLayerPerceptron file will walk you through what is jax , how to setup the jax what are some basic concept of it . Yow will also get to know how to load mnist dataset using pytorch and neural network is build using pytorch and ajax
The multipleLayerPerceptron file contains the neural network classifier and it is build in a way which is easy to understand
All the References which are used in making this neural network is mentioned in the documentation file.

Thank you!!
