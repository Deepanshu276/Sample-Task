# MultiLayer Perceptron
This is a two hidden layers neural network classifier build from scratch using pytorch and jax on google colab.
## Dataset Used 
I used MNIST dataset for this purpose and manually optimized the number of neuron in hidden layers


##Files
The Documentation file will walk you through what is jax , how to setup the jax what are some basic concept of it . Yow will also get to know how to load mnist dataset using pytorch and neural network is build using pytorch and ajax
Hope the documentation will be helpful!!
